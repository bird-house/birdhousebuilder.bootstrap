Todo List
*********

* collect common buildout configs ... may used remotely or copy via selfupdate.
* use buildout for requirements (buildout 2.x can decide between dists ...)
* need test data for unit tests. where to store test data: 
  local mercurial/largefile, git-annex, docker data-only image?
* add "make test" to run unit tests
* boostrap.sh is mainly used to build docker images. Maybe remove bootstrap.sh and move code to Dockerfile template in birdhousebuilder.recipe.docker.
